# howOldAreYou

### An age calculator

This is an age calculator that I set up 3 days after finishing the JavaScript course in codecademy.

The calculator currently takes an input of dd/mm/yyyy and outputs how old you are in Days, Months and Years.

I feel that this is a good first project to work on to become more familiar with using Github.

If anyone would like to work on one of these areas or have any other suggestions for what can be added, let me know
