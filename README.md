# howOldAreYou
###An age calculator
This is an age calculator that I set up 3 days after finishing the JavaScript course in codecademy.

I feel that this is a good first project to work on to become more familiar with using Github.

It is currently full of errors, but I will be correcting those quite soon. There will always be room for improvement.

Areas that can be improved:
- Add a getDate function in the js file (as suggested by JackTierney)
- Improve the CSS
- Remove the current bugs in the js file (entering incorrect dates)
- Perhapse output more information about how old you are eg. how old you are in months
- Add some jquery to make the transitions better
- Improve the js to that it can manage inputs in different forms eg. an input of 20th November 1993 as opposed to 20/11/1993

If anyone would like to work on one of these areas or have any other suggestions for what can be added, let me know
